Q1:Algorithm tracing & purpose
a)Number		Small		Large
   4			4		4
   6			-		6	
   11			-		11
   3			3		-		
   -2			-		-
Explanation:
Ask user for an input which is a number.
Give small a variable for a number.
Give large a variable for a number.
User inputs with the given value of 4. Small, and large is set to 4.
User provides 6 as the next number. Large is set to 6.
User provides 11 as the next number. Large is set to 11.
User provies 3 as the next number. Small is set to 3.
User provides -2 as the next number. It is not a satisfied condition as we are only asking for a positive number.
There is no set number given to small and large because it is a negative number.
Calculate large-small, therefore 11-3 is equal to 8.
Print the value 8.
The algorithm stops.



b)The purpose of the entire algorithm is to find the difference betwen the most recent largestt and smallest values within the dataset after the loop ends.


Q2: Designing & expressing a LEGO algorithm


You are given pieces of legos at hand.
There are an abundant of 2 by 2 lego pieces of each different colour.
There are beige, red, yellow, white, blue, and green.
There are an abundant of 2 by 1 lego pieces of pink colour.
You are given one 16 by 16 grey baseplate.
Start off with the first level of the pyramid.
For the first level of the pyramid use 2 by 2 beige-coloured pieces.
It should take 64 pieces to fill up the first level.
There should be no holes.
For each level of the pyramid, leave one space or stud from the peremeter.
For the second level of the pyramid use 2 by 2 red-coloured pieces.
It should take 49 pieces to fill up the second level.
For the third level of the pyramid use 2 by 2 yellow-coloured pieces.
It should take 36 pieces to fill up the third level.
For the fourth level of the pyramid use 2 by 2 white-coloured pieces.
It should take 25 pieces to fill up the fourth level.
For the fifth level of the pyramid use 2 by 2 blue-coloured pieces.
It should take 16 pieces to fill up the fifth level.
For the sixth level of the pyramid use 2 by 2 green-coloured pieces.
It should take 9 pieces to fill up the sixth level.
For the seventh and final level of the pyramid use 2 by 1 pink-coloured pieces.
Using 6 pieces of the 2 by 1 pieces, leave one space or one stud from the peremeter.
Form a 2 by 2 gap by surrounding it with the 2 by 1 pink pieces.
You are finished!

Calculate the volume of the pyramid in cubic millimetres including the baseplate.
A 2 by 2 lego piece is 1.6cm x 1.6cm x 1.2cm
Convert centimetres to millimetres.
Therefore a 2 by 2 lego piece's dimensions are now 16mm x 16mm x 12mm.
A 2 by 1 by is 0.8cm by 1.6cm x 1.2cm. 
Convert centimetres to millimetres.
Therefore a 2 by 1 lego piece is now 8mm x 16mm x 12mm.
A 16 by 16 baseplate is 12.8 cm x 0.3 cm x 12.8cm.
Convert centimetres to millimetres.
Therefore a 16 by 16 baseplate is 128mm by 3mm by 128mm.

Volume of a 2 by 2 lego piece is calculated by multiplying dimensions.
Multiply 16mm * 16mm * 12mm.
Volume of a 2 by 2 lego piece is now 3072mm cubed.
Repeat process for finding volume of a 2 by 1 lego piece and a 16 by 16 baseplate.
Volume of a 2 by 1 lego piece is now 1536mm cubed.
Volume of a 16 by 16 baseplate is now  49,152mm cubed.

If the first level of the pyramid takes 64 pieces of a 2 by 2 to complete.
You multiply 3072mm cubed * 64 pieces.
Volume of the first level is now 196,608mm cubed.
For the second level, because each level is a perfect square. We just move down from the list of perfect squares.
The second level now requires 47 of the 2 by 2 pieces to fill.
Therefore repeat the multiplication process again.
The second level's volume is now 150,528mm cubed.
Repeat the same process of going down the perfect square and multiplying.
Do the same process until you reach the sixth level.



Q3: Designing & expressing your OWN algorithm.


How to make bubble tea.
The ingredients you need 2 bags of black tea 
2 Bags of black tea per one drink
3/4 cups of powdered tapioca pearls
Your choice of milk
Your choice of sweetener
1/2 cup of brown sugar
1/2 cup of water

Begin with creating your own tapioca pearls.
In a small-sized saucepan on a medium heat setting, add your 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.
Keep the mixture in until it is slowly boiling.
Once it is boiling turn the heat to low.
Add less than 3/4 cups of powdered tapioca pearls.
You will add the remaining cups later.
Mix it between 5-8 minutes and then turn the heat off.
Add the rest of the powdered tapioca pearls and mix.
Once it is doughlike consistency pour it into a flat surface.
Roll it and knead into a smooth dough.
Be quick with separating into portions.
As the dough cools it will firm up.
Take one of the cut portion and roll thinly.
You will cut them into small pieces and roll them into a ball.
Once forming plenty of tapioca balls.
Add them into a bowl and coat more with tapioca powder.
In a sive, shake the excess tapioca powder and make sure the balls are covered in white powder.
Freeze them until ready to make your drink.

Once you are ready to make the drink.
In a small-sized saucepan, add water.
Wait until the water begins to boil.
Begin to add your tapioca pearls in the saucepan.
Wait until the pearl is translucent.
Once the pearl is translucent, turn off the heat.
Add brown sugar to create a syrup-like consistency.
To assemble the drinks.
Prepare 2 bags of black tea in a mug.
Add boiling water to the mug, 1/4 to 1/2 of the mug and brew the tea.
You need space to add milk and your brown sugar.
Wait for a couple of minutes depending on how strong you want the tea is.
Add your own choice of milk and sweetener to your own taste.
Finally, add your tapioca pearls in the brown sugar syrup to the drink.
Do not forget to add ice cubes as well for a refreshing cold drink.
Serve and enjoy!
